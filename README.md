# Simple-Proofs

The idea is to use trees (s-expressions) to do simple proofs.

Currently, it uses 4 axioms about natural numbers and there are 6 example proofs underneath the code demonstrating functionality. 4 of the proofs are trivial and 2 are nontrivial. 

Included is an example file demonstrating the output of running the program.

Run with ./proof.py or python3 proof.py
