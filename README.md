# Simple-Proofs

The idea is to use trees (s-expressions) to do simple proofs.

Currently, it uses four axioms about natural numbers and there are 6 example proofs underneath the code demonstrating functionality. Four of the proofs are trivial and two are nontrivial. 

Included is an example file demonstrating the output of running the program.

Run with ./proof.py or python3 proof.py
