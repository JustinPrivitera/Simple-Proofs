# Simple-Proofs

The idea is to use graphs to do simple proofs.

Currently, it uses a couple axioms about natural numbers and there are two example proofs underneath the code demonstrating functionality. I would like to add more axioms and greater functionality.

Run with ./proof.py or python3 proof.py
